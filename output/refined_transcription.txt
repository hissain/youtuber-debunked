Believe me, when this player accidentally missed the ball, he shocked the world. He immediately stopped and realized the miss wasn't his fault.  He began inspecting the court, noticing the ball bounced unevenly. He checked that the ball bounced less in one spot and more in another. Then Stephen Curry identified a dead spot on the court, showing that a player truly knows his game, and in this case, the floor was uneven.
