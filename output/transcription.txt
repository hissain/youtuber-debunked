 Believe me, when this player accidentally missed the ball, he shocked the world. He immediately stopped and realized that missing the ball wasn't his fault. He began inspecting the court, noticing that the ball kept bouncing unevenly. He checked that the ball was bouncing less in one spot and more in another. Then Stephen Curry identified the dead  dead spot on the court, showing that a player truly knows his game, and in this case the floor wasn't right.
