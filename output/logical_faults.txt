The YouTuber's statement commits several logical fallacies and displays bias.  The initial appeal to belief ("Believe me") is a fallacy of authority, inappropriately substituting personal assurance for evidence.  The description of the player's actions implies a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy;  the uneven bounce is assumed to be the *cause* of the missed shot simply because it followed the miss. No other potential causes for the miss (e.g., player fatigue, poor technique) are considered, demonstrating confirmation biasâ€”seeking only evidence that supports the pre-existing conclusion that the floor was at fault.  Furthermore, the concluding statement ("showing that a player truly knows his game") is an overgeneralization and a red herring; identifying a flawed court surface doesn't inherently demonstrate superior game knowledge, merely attentiveness to environmental factors.  A subtle irony exists in the emphasis on the player's immediate self-exoneration and subsequent focus on external factors, inadvertently highlighting a possible lack of self-critique or acceptance of personal error.
