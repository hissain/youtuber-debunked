The YouTuber's statement commits an appeal to authority fallacy by using Stephen Curry's name to lend credibility to the claim of a flawed court.  This is further compounded by a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; the uneven bounce is presented as the *cause* of the missed shot, simply because it followed the missed shot.  The description includes an implied bias towards Curry, portraying him as exceptionally perceptive and knowledgeable, which is unsupported by the limited evidence presented.  Finally, a degree of irony is present: the speaker emphasizes the player's immediate self-exculpation and subsequent focus on external factors, implying a lack of personal responsibility, while simultaneously praising his understanding of the game.  The overall narrative structure creates a weak causal link between the observation and the conclusion, lacking sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the court flaw definitively caused the missed shot.
